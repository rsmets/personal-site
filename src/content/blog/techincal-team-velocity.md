  Engineering organizations are required to introduce development velocity speed bumps... but I feel one in particular can be acutely detrimental.

### Ticketing Systems and Project Management

I have spent a majority of my career in start up work environments where developer velocity is paramount. In my time authoring software and leading teams I have gained appreciation for many customs that I initially found to be overbearing when trying to write and ship software. Some of those practices include:

- authoring RFCs
- code reviews
- test drive development
- end-to-end tests
- ticket tracking

I have come to the conclusion that the most detrimental of these is overbearing ticket tracking customs. The overhead that comes with having to allot time to keeping tickets up to date not only requires a staggering amount of time and effort but more dangerously hampers fostering a culture of technical staff taking ownership for the complete lifecycle of their work.

In regard to software development, the part of the organization that stands to gain the most from accurate ticket tracking is the product team, not the engineering team. As it is the product individuals whom do not live in the source code management systems, they do not have the same visibility into the progress of the product development. In larger orgs there is also a levels of reporting and management that are even further abstracted from the software development process. Thus the practice of various forms of project management and whole certifications were born with the intent of managing software development: kiban, scrum, agile, etc.

### Side Step Middle Management

One of the most memorable parts of Paul Graham's Hackers and Painter's was his disdain for "pointy haired middle management"... while the spikey hair of the early 2000's has come and lucky stayed gone, this soup of nothingness that is associated with middle management and all operational practices that nurture it should always be with those of us that write software professionally.

In my most recent professional experience I had the opportunity to put my beliefs into action and drop formal ticketing and the Kiban/Scrum management system that was in use. It required fostering a culture of ownership and hiring the right type of experienced developers who not only appreciated a degree of task level ambiguity but thrived on having the agency to make their own decisions on the implementation and means of task management.

### I'm Not Alone?

However, even within my own developer centric communities I felt my stance on this was very much not the norm. To my surprise, and delight, I came across a few other voices that shared the same sentiment.

Of course, developer velocity, while very important in startup environments, is not the only characteristic that should be optimized for. Reliability is often put at odds with velocity, but I would argue that should not be the case with proper organization practices and tactics. I think that the poor project hygiene biggest loser is the non technical project manager - which at a developer conference - we were fine to ignore.

### Concessions

I concede that a loose tracking likely will start to break down if the engineering team size exceeds the mythical number of 5, which famously Bezos' agrees indirectly with the single pizza per team rule of thumb. I also concede that there needs to some form of initiative tracking for organizational clarity but also often for compliance purposes.

The roadmap and the routes necessary to get there are often the responsibility of the product team. I understand why a non-technical individual that doesn't keep version history of their personal notes or task list in git reaches for ticketing systems.

### Final Thoughts

For individuals that interface with version control systems daily and use all the best practices associated with them, I believe the overhead of a ticketing system should be actively avoided given the correct set of circumstances have been met:

- establishment of a clear and transparent product roadmap (quarterly, monthly, or weekly)
- an engineering culture that takes pride in ownership throughout the whole development lifecycle
- an organization culture that leverages the best tools for the task at hand

Tooling that facilitates ticketing based on git workflows is a developing area that I hope continues to improve. I am certain that as foundation models advance so will these services offerings allowing the product team to have visibility that maybe more accustom to without the development team having to invest their time.

In conclusion, in my experience the corner stone practice of always seeking a "why" has lead me to conclusions that are not popular. Luckily, I have been in a position to try some of my engineering leadership practices with high level of success. While tactics that work in one context may not work in another, I sure hope to always find myself on team (or building one) that is also eager to drop the guardrails on of technical project management and ticketing.

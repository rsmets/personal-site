## Intelligent Code Editors

### [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Cursor marked the beginning of the AI-first code editor era. Built as a fork of Visual Studio Code, it introduced features like:

- Multi-line edits.
- Smart rewrites.
- Natural language commands.

It gained popularity for its seamless integration with developer workflows making it considerably better than Github's Copilot VS Code extension. However, **it pales in comparison to Windsurf**.

### [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Released in November 2024, Windsurf advanced the concept of agentic AI in code editing. Key capabilities include:

- Running CLI commands on behalf of developers.
- Full codebase context-awareness.
- Ability to change the underlying LLM model used for code completion.

After using Windsurf in professional and personal project settings for the last few weeks, I can say without a doubt that **it is the most impressive developer tool I have used in all of 2024**.

Its ability to automatically run CLI commands with all of the context of the project's source code is the next-level aspect of this tool.

An example of this that blew me away was setting up a high availability Redis Sentinel Helm deployment that had Redis Stack modules but used Bitnami's Redis chart (which does not support Redis Stack Server natively). It was doing things like looking at the Kubernetes state via `kubectl` to figure out what needed to be updated in the deployment configs and then verifying it by pulling the image locally and going through the file structure to verify its suggestion would work. The solution it arrived at was simple yet not obvious, however it saved me hours of researching industry practices and sytax for using an init container and then volume mounting files between the Reids Stack image and the vanilla Redis image. This was after presenting two complex solutions and getting input from me for which path to pursue. It felt like I got to speak with an absolute developer ninja who knew precisely what to do and then took the keyboard from me and did it while I looked over their shoulder.

**Recommendation**: Treat it like the principal engineer that sits next to you in the office - it can help with anything source code related and sometimes you can just fork over your keyboard and watch magic happen.

## Full-Stack Development Tools

### [Vercel v0](https://vercel.com/)

A year ago, Vercel v0 was the pinnacle of AI-assisted development for deploying and scaling web applications. However, its prominence has waned as new tools emerged. Most recently, the deeper Vercel integration allows for deployed and managing custom DNS - which I image is a major benefit for some, but for any real developers, this is trivial already.

### [Lovable.dev](https://www.lovable.dev/)

This tool has set a new standard by offering:

- Agentic development capabilities for full-stack applications.
- An integrated persistence and use management layer via Supabase.
- An opinionated Typescript stack perfect for prototyping web applications.

Lovable.dev eliminates the need for extensive configuration, empowering developers to focus on prototyping. The downside to this tool currently is not being able to have it manipulate existing projects.

**Recommendation**: Think of it as rockstar intern code monkey. Very talented and very useful but requires a far amount of direction.

## The Rise of Open-Source Agentic AI Frameworks

The past two months have seen open-source agentic AI frameworks take off, democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities. I talked about my favorite, Eliza, in a previous blog post, [Agentic AI Tooling](https://www.raysmets.me/blog/agentic-ai-tooling). This surge is expected to fuel a frenzy in the private startup sector, driving innovation and competition.

## Conclusion

From Windsurf's intelligent fully contextual code editing to Lovable.dev's full-stack agentic development convenience, AI tooling is evolving rapidly. With the rise of agent AI open-source frameworks, the future for developers is limitless, heralding a new era of innovation.

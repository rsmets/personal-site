Putting together a functional agentic AI app as never been easier. With a host of models to choice from and frameworks to assist all it takes a little the drive.

## Agent Frameworks

Some of the most popular AI frameworks:

- CrewAI
- Agentic

Most favorite:

- Eliza

Why? It is simply all in Typescript. I language I much prefer to the predominantly popular Python, amongst the data crowd. _I have a dream that python disappears one day, with all the “coders” and data folks that use it being replaced by ai agents who rewrite themselves into a more sensible language._

### Models

LLM models accessible via the API is no longer cutting edge. They have been available for many years now. Some popular cloud accessible models are:

- GPT-4o
- Claude 3.5
- Llama
- RedPill

### Supporting Tools

In addition to frameworks that leverage prebuilt models, the bells whistles products aka supporting toolchains, are not surprisingly extensive as well. They support a countless bits of functionality but my favorites are custom voice and video avatar solutions.

#### Voice

My favorite custom voice service is offered by ElevenLabs.

#### Avatar

Smili's offering is the one I'm most familiar with, however I'm not terribly impressed by it. I would like to get hands on experience the OSS project [EchoMic](https://github.com/antgroup/echomimic) to allow for more customizability.

### Demo

The best way to keep on top of these tools is to use them! So, using Eliza, I clone myself, my mother-in-law and Santa into an AI agent with knowledge, memories, and uniquely styled communication patterns. They were powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o and I used ElevenLabs and Simili for the avatars. Putting it all together, I had AI agents that my family could converse with this thanksgiving. Please check out final outcome in on the project page.

In a recent experience, I encountered a moment that highlighted the delicate balance between friendship and professionalism within the workplace, especially when those roles intersect with leadership.

## The Feedback Dilemma

During an informal discussion, where feedback was shared in a manner more reminiscent of a chat between friends rather than a structured performance review, I overheard a comment that was not only surprising but somewhat unsettling. The feedback was, "You are not hard-working enough." This casual remark, meant to be a friendly nudge, did not seem thoroughly considered. The individual in question was objetively very driven and hardworking. Yet, even they were taken back from this comment coming from their superior in the professional organization. It was clear neither participants left that initial conversation in a satisfactory state.

### Professional vs. Personal

As someone who sees their role not just as a co-worker but also as a leader and a friend, I value unfiltered communication. However, such openness that allows for remarks stated with good intention ends up being dance on thin ice. It is precisely why I am cautious about labeling co-workers as friends. To achieve our common goals, we must always view our interactions through a professional lens. The relationship dictates a level of thoughtfulness not demanded when interacting with a casual friend.

### Literature

Reid Hoffman's _No Rules Rules_ book is one of my favorites in regard to building professional cultures. That book requires its own blog post to cover my thoughts but in regard to this post, it does drive home the need for honest and thoughtful communication. I believe that a pure friendship demands the same level of honesty but affords a level of forgiveness on the thoughtfulness front which is paramount in the workspace.

## Concluding Thoughts

Navigating friendship and professionalism in the workplace requires clear boundaries and well-thought-out communication strategies. While friendship can enrich workplace relationships, it becomes essential to maintain professionalism to ensure that work dynamics remain unaffected by personal biases or misunderstandings.

In the end, feedback should be constructive, well-timed, and delivered in an appropriate setting to foster growth and clarity, not confusion and doubt.

As part of my graduate Information Security degree studies, I was required to complete a practicum project to serve as a capstone. I chose to focus on a new approach to application development via public blockchains, which provides users with true online ownership and identity control.

### Motivation

My interest in this new paradigm of application development became clear while I was managing the backend for an access control startup. I realized that I had the ability to impersonate any user within our application. This reliance on trust in service operators is a fundamental issue that blockchain applications address through the nature of asymmetric cryptography in every transaction. Furthermore, I could manipulate or erase access logs if I wanted, a problem that blockchains solve by providing immutable transaction records.

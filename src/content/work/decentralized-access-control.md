Part of my graduated Information Security degree studies required a practicum project to server as a capstone. I opted to do mine of a new way of application development via public blockchains which affords the users a true sense of online ownership and identity.

### Motivation

My interest in this new paradigm in application development was innate clear to me while I was running the backend for n access control startup and I could impersonate any and all users in relation to our application. This trust in the service operators is something was clear blockchain apps solved thanks to asymmetric cryptography nature of each and every transaction. Additionally, I could scrub access logs if I wanted, another characteristic - immutable transaction records - that blockchains provide.

Vinyl Finance, https://www.vinylfinance.xyz/, home to the grooviest algorithmic token fork pegged to $FTM on the Fantom Opera network and first of its kind Vinyl tNFT Marketplace.

It was an ambitious project where I had the opportunity to get hands on with cutting edge EVM, Ethereum Virtual Machine, develop practice. Deciding to use the cutting edge professional grade development framework, [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), as my frame work of choice and take the idea from inception to local chain deployment to mainnet deployment.

Deciding to use Hardhat of Truffle, the first and more popular EVM development framework at the time was a pivotal decision. Since Hardhat has been nodded at the defacto framework for modern EVM development thanks to all the tooling to assist through the whole application development lifecycle: testing, package management, and deployments.

As a means of building community trust and living by best practices I went to great lengths of authoring extensive protocol [documentation](https://vinyl-finance.github.io/vinylfinance-docs/docs/welcome) as well as undergoing a [KYC](https://vinyl-finance.github.io/vinylfinance-docs/docs/security/kyc), Know You Customer, verification.

The Seigniorage protocol peaked with over $2,000,000 in TVL, Total Locked Value in 2022 shortly after launch. It was a wild ride which was a crash course in the wild wild west of defi, decentralized finance development. Frankly, at every turn I could have manipulated the protocol and ran off with the community's funds. It exposed the underbelly of the not so trustless nature of defi protocol at the time. Furthermore, I learned first hand of the exhausting nature of building a protocol then the relentless energy required to appease the community. For next time, I will certainly be asking for more community management assistance.

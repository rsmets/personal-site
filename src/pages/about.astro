				<div class="content">
					<p>
						On all my professional profiles, I state, "hacker by nature," because it is very much true. I have always been drawn to making something out of nothing. Luckily for me, my passion has allowed me to gain expertise in areas that would have seemed like science fiction just a handful of decades ago.
					</p><br/>
					<p>
						Distributed systems and network security guided my academic pursuits. However, I have also maintained a love for electronics and my fundamental understanding of electrical engineering through many microcontroller projects. Starting with an Arduino Uno 15 years ago and now mostly using ESP32, I love writing C, using my multimeter, and making pretty LEDs blink in my free time.
					</p><br/>
					<p>
						Professionally, I have always sought environments that allowed me to grow and learn as quickly and intensely as I was my passion. This has lead me to a part of mostly startups where I have had the opportunity to see the full lifecycle of a product from inception, to mvp, hyperscaling, and also to end of life.
					</p>
					</p><br/>
					<p>
						Personally, I am lucky to have met the love of my life in 2019 before the world stood still in 2020. We officially tied the knot at a cercemony on Sayulita, Mexico in Feburary 2023. We love to travel, backpack, and explore new places. She is also very passionate about her career and has been a great inspiration to me and personal project partner in crime. Those infinity mirror collars would not have their housing if it wasn't for her!

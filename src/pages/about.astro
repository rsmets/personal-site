				<div class="content">
					<p>
						On all my professional profiles, I state, "hacker by nature," because it is very much true. I have always been drawn to making something out of nothing. Luckily for me, my passion has allowed me to gain expertise in areas that would have seemed like science fiction just a handful of decades ago.
					</p><br/>
					<p>
						Distributed systems and network security guided my academic pursuits. However, I have also maintained a love for electronics and my fundamental understanding of electrical engineering through many microcontroller projects. Starting with an Arduino Uno 15 years ago and now mostly using ESP32, I love writing C, using my multimeter, and making pretty LEDs blink in my free time.
					</p><br/>
					<p>
						Professionally, I have always sought environments that allowed me to grow and learn. I have been a part of many startups and have had the opportunity to see the full lifecycle of a product from inception to end of life. I have been part of many teams and have led several of them. I've had the privilege to mentor and be mentored by some of the best in the industry.
